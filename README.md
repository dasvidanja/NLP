# NLP
The contents of this repositotry were developed for a seminar presentend to incoming freshman students. The presentation attempts to give a glimpse of the fascinating 
world of NLP. It exposes students to basic text pre-processing and analysis. Altough, it covers merely the basics it is an introduction that aims at pushing students 
to 'fall in love' with NLP and investigate it further. 

There is as well a python file, which has examples and possible exercises for the students to attempt. 

I have attempted to reference all of the work that was "borrowed" by more authentic sources. Please reach out to me if I have failed to do so.
